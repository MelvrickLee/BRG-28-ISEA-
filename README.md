Since I had prior experience with GitHub, I had no trouble creating a repository

<br/> 
As Git was not covered, I used GitHub App to clone the repository onto my local machine

This screenshot shows the folder of the local repository in windows file explorer

*note that ReadmeBackup.md was added in between the screenshots

*contents of "Documents"

mkdir makes a folder inside the working directory i am in. I can also specify the file name. Following from the cd command, I will create a folder named "ISEA" and change directory to there
