Since I had prior experience with GitHub, I had no trouble creating a repository

<br/> 
As Git was not covered, I used GitHub App to clone the repository onto my local machine

This screenshot shows the folder of the local repository in windows file explorer
*note that ReadmeBackup.md was added in between the screenshots
