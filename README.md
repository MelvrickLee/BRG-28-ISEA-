Session 1a

Obtaining Linux:



Installation process is straightforward, but it seems like default memory allocation for video is insufficient for Ubuntu (will result in black screen with nothing happening). 32mb is needed.



Installation process is slow, maybe increasing CPU will make it go faster?

CLI Fam:



pressing 1 and q whilst in "top" is the same as navigating a menu and pressing options

ls -la displays more information on ls. But i do not know what the information is presenting as of yet.

The difference between nano and gedit/featherpad is that nano uses CLI whilst the latter uses GUI to edit text. As this is the case, i will not be able to edit the text using gedit if i only have a remote terminal prompt.

cp copies the file whilst mv renames the file

after experimenting, i believe that ls shows me a simplified directory whilst ls -lah shows me when the file was last updated/accessed



uname shows the system information, along with the os version and when it was last updated. lsb\_release looks for lsb\_module and displays the current OS information like version name, current version number and the distributor



ls -alt seems to display when the file was last altered. hostnamectl displays system information that is easily readable to humans.
