Session 1a

Obtaining Linux:



Installation process is straightforward, but it seems like default memory allocation for video is insufficient for Ubuntu (will result in black screen with nothing happening). 32mb is needed.



Installation process is slow, maybe increasing CPU will make it go faster?

CLI Fam:



pressing 1 and q whilst in "top" is the same as navigating a menu and pressing options

ls -la displays more information on ls. But i do not know what the information is presenting as of yet.

The difference between nano and gedit/featherpad is that nano uses CLI whilst the latter uses GUI to edit text. As this is the case, i will not be able to edit the text using gedit if i only have a remote terminal prompt.
